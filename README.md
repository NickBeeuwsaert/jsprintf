# JSprintf

Here we have a little sprintf implementation for javascript!

## TODO

* Implement some features
* Add tests. Everybody loves tests

## BONUS FEATURES
This library doubles as a left padding module. Watch:

```
let left_pad = require("jsprintf").lpad;

console.log(left_pad("Hello", 10, '0')); // -> 00000Hello
```

Cool, huh?
