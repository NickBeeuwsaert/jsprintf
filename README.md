# Hello!

Here we have a crappy little sprintf implementation for javascript! yay!

Things to note! 

    * the parameters list has to be in a array in the second argument! I don't like using javascripts arguments keyword thing!
    
    * some things(like precision) haven't been implemented, so feel free to submit a pull request if by I haven't implemented this by the time you are reading it
    
So that about covers it I guess
